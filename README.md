## Quality of Life
There are many items that are heavily relied on RNG or takes a while to obtain which is frustrating for players. Here are the list of **every** changes to improve player's experience:
- Craftable elytra: The endgame item which require players to find an End City with a flying ship. Many players avoid getting an elytra due to how much time it could take, not to mention that they could get lost and have no way home
  - Added crafting recipe for elytra using Totem of Undying, an equally hard-to-obtain items
