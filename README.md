# Minecraft Mod
This ReadMe outlines all the features and functionalities in this mod

## Quality of Life
There are many items that are heavily relied on RNG or takes a while to obtain which is frustrating for players. Here are the list of **every** changes to improve player's experience:
- Craftable elytra: The endgame item which require players to find an End City with a flying ship. Many players avoid getting an elytra due to how much time it could take, not to mention that they could get lost and have no way home
  - Added crafting recipe for elytra using Totem of Undying, an equally hard-to-obtain items

- Craftable trident: The weapon that is very hard to obtain. The player must kill a Drowned spawned with a trident (6.25%) and have a 8.5% chance of having it dropped. The chance of killing any Drowned and have it dropped is 0.53%
  - Added crafting recipe for trident using Heart of the Sea

## Transmutation Wand & Block of Transmutation:
Allow players to transmute or downgrade blocks and items. Transmutation Wand only allows players to transmute blocks while Block of Transmutation allow players to transmute blocks & items when **thrown on top**.
These transmutation can be downgrading blocks (Iron Block → Copper Block → Coal Block) or transmuting blocks (Black Wool → Blue Wool)

*Due to how much items & blocks you can transmute, a full list is in their respective txt file. In that file, there will be **Item 1** → **Item 2**. This means you can transmute from Item 1 to Item 2.*

**Note that not every items and blocks get their own transmutation**

For example a common mob drop cycles will neither contain zombie's iron ingot drop since iron is already used for ore downgrading (gold ingot → iron ingot → copper ingot)
nor zombie's carrot and potato drop since carrot and potato is already used for crop cycling 

### Transmutation Wand: Crafted from 2 sticks and 1 John Pork's Meat
